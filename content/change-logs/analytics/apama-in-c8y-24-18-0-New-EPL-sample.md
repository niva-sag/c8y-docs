A new EPL sample named "Receive update notifications"
can now be accessed from the EPL editor of the Streaming Analytics application.
It shows how to write an EPL app that can distinguish between notifications for creating and updating managed objects, measurements, alarms, events, and operations.
See also [Developing apps with the Streaming Analytics application](/streaming-analytics/epl-apps/#dev-apps-with-sa).

For more detailed information, see [Receiving update notifications](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pam/10.15.3/en/webhelp/pam-webhelp/index.html#page/pam-webhelp%2Fco-ConApaAppToExtCom_cumulocity_receiving_update_notifications.html) in the Apama documentation for the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} transport connectivity plug-in.
