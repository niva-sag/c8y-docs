The right drawer of the Streaming Analytics application, which is displayed when you click the **User** button, now includes a **Bookmarks** section. This means that the bookmarks you have added in other {{< product-c8y-iot >}} applications are now also available in the Streaming Analytics application, and you can now also add bookmarks for the pages in the Streaming Analytics application.
