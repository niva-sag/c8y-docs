The link from the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} UI to the documentation for the Edge component was previously outdated. With this change, the link has been updated to point to the correct location in the documentation. This ensures that users can easily access the relevant information and guidance for using the Edge component without encountering any broken links or navigation issues.
