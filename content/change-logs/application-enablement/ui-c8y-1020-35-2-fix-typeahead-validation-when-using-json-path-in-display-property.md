Previously, when using a JSON path in the 'displayProperty' of a typeahead control, the validation not allowing free entries (allowFreeEntries = false) was not working correctly and could lead to unexpected behavior, like creating orphan entries when an item needs to be assigned to a parent entity, etc. This issue has now been fixed. This change improves the reliability and usability of typeahead controls in forms.
